## Kirstin Ditata   
*Fullstack web developer*   

The unique path I took to web development forced me to think critically and creatively to find solutions. I learned to code while I was incarcerated, without the use of the internet (yes, including Google). Limited screen time for writing and testing code followed by a COVID lockdown that kept me away from the computer for months left me with one option, a pencil and paper. In a crowded chaotic environment I hand wrote much of the backend of one of my projects, down to the MongoDB schema and Node server. Coding is in my blood and I will do whatever it takes to complete a project.
